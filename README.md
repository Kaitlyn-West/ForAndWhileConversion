# ForAndWhileConversion
this is a c++ program to read in a file containing a for/while loop in c++, and covert it to a while/for loop. 
- the program assumes that the first line of the file is not empty unless there is no update statment for a while loop
- the program assumes that a for loop will not have any code preceding the for loop.
- the program assumes the loops are formated to have a space between the keyword and the opening parenthases.
- the program assumes that while loops only have one expression preceding the loop's header
- the program assumes that a while loop with an initialization statment will have a newline before the loop's header
- the program assumes that loops have the opening curly brace on the same line as the header
- the program assumes that loops have the closing brace on its own line.
Two example input files have been included in the repository, for.txt and while.txt
